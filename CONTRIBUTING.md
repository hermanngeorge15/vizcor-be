# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! 🙌

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch from `main` (e.g. `feature/short-title` or `fix/bug-name`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and formatting locally (if available)
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description

## PR checklist
- [ ] The change is small and focused (or split into multiple PRs)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Build/tests pass locally
- [ ] Docs/README updated (if needed)

## Communication
If you’re unsure, open an Issue or Discussion first and describe what you want to do.
